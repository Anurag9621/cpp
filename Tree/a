Number of binary tree in given node 
catalan formula:-   ^2nCn/n+1

Max height of binary tree is 2^n-1
height starts with 0,1,2....
depth start with 1,2,3...

lable node of number of binary tree is 
    (^2nCn/n+1)*n!


            HEIGHT Vs NODE 
            if Height is given
    min node reguired to form a certain binary tree is:-n= h+1
    max node contain in certain binary tree in given height:-n= ((2^(h+1))-1)
            if Node is given
    min:-h= log(n+1)-1
    max:-h= n-1


    HEIGHT OF BINARY TREE
    log(n+1)-1<=h<=n-1
    NUMBER OF NODES IN BINARY TREE
    h+1<=n<=(2^(h+1))-1
