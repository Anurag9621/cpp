Number of binary tree in given node 
catalan formula:-   ^2nCn/n+1

Max height of binary tree is 2^n-1
height starts with 0,1,2....
depth start with 1,2,3...

lable node of number of binary tree is 
    (^2nCn/n+1)*n!


            HEIGHT Vs NODE 
    min node reguired to form a certain binary tree is:- h+1
    max node contain in certain binary tree in given height:- ((2^(h+1))-1)
